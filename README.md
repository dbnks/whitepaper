## Abstract
Consumers and everyday users of the web simply don't understand cryptocurrencies, nor are there any solutions presently available that allow for consumers to take an easy dive into the crypto world. Banking systems, banks and banking software were created to give users an easily understandable way of managing their portfolio of government-issued currencies. This ultimately gives government-issued currencies a usability edge over cryptocurrencies for the typical internet user who lacks a technical skill set. 

We cannot expect the population at-large to move over to a better alternative, if the learning curve seems out of reach for the typical user or if solutions aren't designed for mass adoption, where usability is combined with the advantages brought to life by blockchain technology as well as the cryptocurrencies distributed across blockchain-based networks. Bitcoin, combined with many other cryptocurrencies like ETH, EOS and BCH, present stable people-backed currencies that could truly help level the playing field for the masses. Although, both businesses and regular users alike, are without a decentralized banking system, decentralized bank and decentralized banking software that ultimately gives them an easily understandable way of managing these people-backed currencies. This is clearly an issue when it comes to mass adoption and one that we set out to fix with the AriseBank project in 2018.

Building a decentralized banking system is a monumental project. One that is sure to anger some of the most powerful people in the world. In fact, if we fail to create a truly decentralized banking system -- cryptocurrencies will never gain mass appeal and will surely succumb to a lack of adoption. dBnk is an open-source rebirth of the AriseBank project, where all the loose ends that were used to attack the Arise project have been corrected, development is being self-funded by the people and where the technology itself will bring to life a truly end-to-end decentralized experience for users. dBnk is being built upon the [Arisen](https://github.com/arisenio/technical-whitepaper) blockchain, a blockchain launched by the original developer of AriseBank, as well as the dWeb protocol, a true alternative to the centralized web. 

dBnk's ultimate focus is to be usable by anyone, ultimately giving anybody an easy pathway to enter the cryptoverse, while also making sure the system is completely decentralized and therefore taking away a centralized power's ability to seize it. dBnk will be a place where users control their own money and therefore their own destiny. A place where businesses can do the same and easily exchange value with the system's users, almost effortlessly. dBnk truly brings to life a People's banking system, allowing for the decentralized web and decentralized applications of the future to take flight, while also putting the centralized tyrants of the world on notice - that the time has come for "We The People" to take back what is truly ours. Our freedom.
